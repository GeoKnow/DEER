  abstract = {The Web of Data is built upon two simple ideas: Employ the RDF data
	model to publish structured data on the Web and to create explicit
	data links between entities within different data sources. This paper
	presents the Silk – Linking Framework, a toolkit for discovering
	and maintaining data links between Web data sources. Silk consists
	of three components: 1. A link discovery engine, which computes links
	between data sources based on a declarative specification of the
	conditions that entities must fulfill in order to be interlinked;
	2. A tool for evaluating the generated data links in order to fine-tune
	the org.aksw.deer.resources.linking specification; 3. A protocol for maintaining data links
	between continuously changing data sources. The protocol allows data
	sources to exchange both linksets as well as detailed change information
	and enables continuous link recomputation. The interplay of all the
	components is demonstrated within a life science use case.},
